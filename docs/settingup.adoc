[#Setup]
Before we start the lab, its important that you read the following instructions carefully. These instructions will be refered from the rest of the content if you need to come back to them.

[#prerequisite]
== First Step: Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

image::setuser.png[Set User ID above, 700]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidentally type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste"

== The Workshop Environment You Are Using

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-installed and are ready to use. Depending on which parts of the workshop you’re doing, you will use one or more of:

* https://www.OpenShift.com/[Red Hat OpenShift,window=_blank] - You’ll use one or more *projects* (Kubernetes namespaces) that are your own and are isolated from other workshop students
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/OpenShift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces,window=_blank] - Built on the open Eclipse Che project, Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide any member of the development or IT team with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment. The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment on your laptop. OpenShift Dev Spaces is included with your OpenShift subscription and is available in the Operator Hub. It provides development teams a faster and more reliable foundation on which to work, and it gives operations centralized control and peace of mind.
* https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes, window=_blank] - a collection of cloud-native runtimes and platform that enables Spring Boot, Node.js, and https://quarkus.io[Quarkus, window=_blank] developers to create Cloud-native apps with ease.


=== About your workspace environment
For developments and deployment, we use the using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipe Che, window=_blank]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don't need to save changes explicitly.

To get started, {{ CHE_URL }}[access the CodeReady Workspaces instance^] and log in using the username and password you are assigned (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

By logging in to CodeReady, you get access to your development workspace. We have already created a workspace for you. Your development environment opens up by clicking the workspace on the left menu.

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g., Git), debugging, and other plugins. You'll use these during this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g., _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

Let's import our first project. Click on **Git Clone..** (or type kbd:[F1], enter 'git' and click on the auto-completed _Git Clone.._ )

image::gitclonepage.png[cdw, 600, align="center"]

Step through the prompts, using the following value for **Repository URL**. If you use *FireFox*, it may end up pasting extra spaces at the end, so just press backspace after pasting:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]

The project is now imported into your workspace. Following screenshot shows the workspace after the lab projects have been imported.

1. On the left you can see the project explorer with the heading *EXPLORER:PROJECTS*. Project explorer can be used to navigate to source files. Once you click any source file. it will open up in the editor.
2. On the right is the `Workspace Command View` with the heading *MYWORKSPACE:WORKSPACE*. In this view we have created point and click commands. These commands will be used through out the workshop labs.


Perfect, now you should have an IDE setup. Lets move on to the workshop.

== How to complete this workshop

Click the "Next >" button at the bottom to advance to the next topic. You can also use the menu on the left to move around the instructions at will.

Good luck, and let’s get started!
