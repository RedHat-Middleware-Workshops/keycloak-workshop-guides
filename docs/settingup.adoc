[#Setup]
Before we start the lab, its important that you read the following instructions carefully. These instructions will be refered from the rest of the content if you need to come back to them.

[#prerequisite]
== First Step: Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidentally type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

== The Workshop Environment You Are Using
Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-installed and are ready to use. Depending on which parts of the workshop you’re doing, you will use one or more of:

* https://www.OpenShift.com/[Red Hat OpenShift,window=_blank] - You’ll use one or more *projects* (Kubernetes namespaces) that are your own and are isolated from other workshop students
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/OpenShift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces,window=_blank] - Built on the open Eclipse Che project, Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide any member of the development or IT team with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment. The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment on your laptop. OpenShift Dev Spaces is included with your OpenShift subscription and is available in the Operator Hub. It provides development teams a faster and more reliable foundation on which to work, and it gives operations centralized control and peace of mind.
* https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes, window=_blank] - a collection of cloud-native runtimes and platform that enables Spring Boot, Node.js, and https://quarkus.io[Quarkus, window=_blank] developers to create Cloud-native apps with ease.


You will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^]. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ CHE_URL }}[Open this link^] which should take you to the Dev Spaces console and press *Log in with OpenShift* button:
