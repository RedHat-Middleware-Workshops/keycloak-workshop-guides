== Conclusion

Achievment unlocked, you made it! Congratulations. We hope you enjoyed the labs and learnt alot more about Red Hat SSO and Keycloak and how to leverage it in a Cloud native and microservices world. There is alot more to Red Hat SSO and that was not illustrated in this workshop.

=== Clustering and Caching

Red Hat SSO leverages Infinispan to cache everything loaded from the database and user stores like LDAP. This removes the need to go to the database for every request.

Infinispan also enables us to provide a clustered mode where user sessions are distributed throughout the cluster. Enabling load balancing as well as redundancy.

Not only does Infinispan allow us to cluster within a single data center, but we also have support for multiple data centers. This works, but there are a few improvements that can be made here.

=== Authorization Services

Red Hat SSO provides a way to centrally manage permissions for resources as well as support for UMA 2.0 that enables users themselves to manage permissions to their own resources.


=== Dynamic Client Registration

Red Hat SSO has a very powerful dynamic client registration service that allows users and applications themselves to register clients through a REST API. This supports clients defined in Red Hat SSO's own client representation, standard OpenID Connect client format as well as SAML 2.0 client format.

It is also possible to define policies on what is permitted. For example you can restrict this service to specific IP ranges, automatically require consent and a lot of other policies. You can also develop your own custom policies.
OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0

Red Hat SSO provides support for both OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0.
