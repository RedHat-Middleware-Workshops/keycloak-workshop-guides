== What is Red Hat SSO / keycloak

Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) is based on the Keycloak project and enables you to secure your web applications by providing Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities based on popular standards such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. The RH-SSO server can act as a SAML or OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider, mediating with your enterprise user directory or 3rd-party SSO provider for identity information and your applications via standards-based tokens.

Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It makes it easy to secure applications and services with little to no code.

This page gives a brief introduction to RH-SSO and Keycloak and some of the features. For a full list of features refer to the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/[documentation]


Trying RH-SSO is quick and easy. And we will take a deep dive into RH-SSO in this workshop. But first; What is RH-SSO?

=== Single-Sign On

Users authenticate with RH-SSO rather than individual applications. This means that your applications don't have to deal with login forms, authenticating users, and storing users. Once logged-in to RH-SSO, users don't have to login again to access a different application.

This also applied to logout. RH-SSO provides single-sign out, which means users only have to logout once to be logged-out of all applications that use RH-SSO.

=== Kerberos bridge

If your users authenticate to workstations with Kerberos (LDAP or active directory) they can also be automatically authenticated to RH-SSO without having to provide their username and password again after they log on to the workstation.

=== Identity Brokering and Social Login

Enabling login with social networks is easy to add through the admin console. It's just a matter of selecting the social network you want to add. No code or changes to your application is required.

RH-SSO can also authenticate users with existing OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 Identity Providers. Again, this is just a matter of configuring the Identity Provider through the admin console.

=== User Federation

RH-SSO has built-in support to connect to existing LDAP or Active Directory servers. You can also implement your own provider if you have users in other stores, such as a relational database.

=== Client Adapters

RH-SSO Client Adapters makes it really easy to secure applications and services. We have adapters available for a number of platforms and programming languages, but if there's not one available for your chosen platform don't worry. RH-SSO is built on standard protocols so you can use any OpenID Connect Resource Library or SAML 2.0 Service Provider library out there.
Gatekeeper

You can also opt to use a proxy to secure your applications which removes the need to modify your application at all.

=== Admin Console

Through the admin console administrators can centrally manage all aspects of the RH-SSO server.

They can enable and disable various features. They can configure identity brokering and user federation.

They can create and manage applications and services, and define fine-grained authorization policies.

They can also manage users, including permissions and sessions.

=== Account Management Console

Through the account management console users can manage their own accounts. They can update the profile, change passwords, and setup two-factor authentication.

Users can also manage sessions as well as view history for the account.

If you've enabled social login or identity brokering users can also link their accounts with additional providers to allow them to authenticate to the same account with different identity providers.


=== Standard Protocols

RH-SSO is based on standard protocols and provides support for OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
Authorization Services

If role based authorization doesn't cover your needs, RH-SSO provides fine-grained authorization services as well. This allows you to manage permissions for all your services from the RH-SSO admin console and gives you the power to define exactly the policies you need.
